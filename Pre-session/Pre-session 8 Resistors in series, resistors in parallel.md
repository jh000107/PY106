# Pre-session 8: Resistors in series, resistors in parallel

If a battery is connected to a single 10 Ω resistor, and is divided into two pieces, one 40% as long as the original and one 60% as long, the pieces have resistances of 4 Ω and 6 Ω because resistance is directly proportional to length.

If the 4 Ω and 6 Ω resistors are connected by a wire of negligible resistance, the battery sees no difference between the single 10 Ω resistor and the 4 Ω and 6 Ω resistors since the battery is still trying to force charge to flow through a total resistance of 10 Ω.

$R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ...$

The total resistance of a bunch of resistors in series is just the sum of their individual resistances.

### Current in series - sumamry

The potential differences across the individual resistors add together to equal  the battery voltage. This is to be expected from Kirchoff's loop rule. In a series circuit, the loop rule tells us that the sum of the potential differences across the resistors equals the battery voltage.

**Key ideas for series circuits:** Components in a series circuit have equal currents passing through them. The sum of the potential differences across the resistors in a series circuit is equal to the battery voltage.

## Resistors in parallel

When charge has more than one path to choose from between two points in a circuit, we say that those paths are in parallel with one another. Interestingly, adding a resistor to a circuit can actually decrease the resistance of that circuit if the resistor is placed in parallel with another resistor in the circuit.

$\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+...$

## Current in parallel, summary

In a parallel circuit, the currents through the individual resistors add together to equal the current from the battery. This is consistent with Kirchoff's junction rule, which says the current entering a junction equals the current leaving the junction.

Components in parallel with one another have the same potential difference across them. Current splits between parallel paths, with more current passing through the path with lower resistance.
