# Pre-session 3: Electric Field

## Electric Field

There are many parallels between electrostatic situations and gravitational situations. A field is something that has a magnitude and direction at all points in space.

E = Electric Field

Fe = Electric Force

q = charge

**Magnitude of the field from a point charge: E = kq / r^2**

where r is the distance from the charge to the point in space where we are finding the field. The electric field points away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.

## Visualizing the Electric Field

First, using field lines.

Figure (a) represents a uniform electric field directed down.

Figure (b) represents the electric field near a negative point charge.

Figure (c) represents the field from an electric dipole, which consits of two objects with equal-and-opposite charge.

The arrow shows the direction of the electric field at all points along the field line and the relative strength of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines.

Secondly, using field vectors.

The basic idea is similar to that of using field lines. The difference is that the relative strength of the field is indicated by the darkness of the arrow.
