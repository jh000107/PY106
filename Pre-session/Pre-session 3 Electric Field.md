# Pre-session 3: Electric Field

## Electric Field

There are many parallels between electrostatic situations and gravitational situations. A field is something that has a magnitude and direction at all points in space.

The electric field E at a particular point can be defined in terms of the electric force, Fe, that an object of charge q would experience if it were placed at that point.

E = Electric Field

Fe = Electric Force

q = charge

where r is the distance from the charge to the point in space where we are finding the field. The electric field points away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.

## Visualizing the Electric Field

First, using field lines.

Figure (a) represents a uniform electric field directed down.

Figure (b) represents the electric field near a negative point charge.

Figure (c) represents the field from an electric dipole, which consits of two objects with equal-and-opposite charge.

The arrow shows the direction of the electric field at all points along the field line and the relative strength of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines.

Secondly, using field vectors.

The basic idea is similar to that of using field lines. The difference is that the relative strength of the field is indicated by the darkness of the arrow.

## A Test Charge

Based on the relationship Fe = qE, the force on a positive test charge is in the direction of the electric field at the point where the test charge is, and the size of the force is proportional to the magnitude of the field at that point.

### Uniform field

The free-body diagram at below shows the two forces applied to the proton, the downward force of gravity and the downard force applied by the electric field.

## Field = Zero

The two individual fields add as vectors, so they must cancel one another for the net field to be zero. In other words, we're looking for the locations where the two fields have the same magnitude and point in opposite directions.

### Opposite directions

In which regions are the two electric fields, one from the +2Q charge and one from the -5Q charge, in opposite directions? Select all that apply. Confine yourself to points on the line passing through both charges.

Answer: 

* To the left of the +2Q charge 
* To the right of the -5Q charge

Reasoning:

For electric field, the arrows point away from the positive charge and towards the negative charge. Hence, to the left of +2Q charge, and to the right of the -5Q charge.

### Account for magnitude

In which region(s) is there at least one point, a finite distance from the charges, where the two electric fields, one from the +2Q charge and one from the -5Q charge, are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction? Select all that apply. Confine yourself to points on the line passing through both charges.

Answer:

* To the left of the +2Q charge

Reasoning:

They are opposite charges so it cannot be in between the two charges. Since the positive charge is smaller than the negative charge, a point must be closer to the left of the positive charge.

## Electric field near conductors

At equilibrium, the conduction electrons in a conductor move about randomly, somewhat like atoms of ideal gas, but there is no net flow of charge in any direction. If there is a change in the external electric field the conductor is exposed to, however, the conduction electrons respond by redistributing themselves, very quickly coming to a new equilibrium distribution. At equilibrium, a number of conditions apply:

1. There is no electric field inside the solid part of the conductor.
2. The electric field at the surface of the conductor is perpendicular to the surface.
3. If the conductor is charged, excess charge lies only at the surface of the conductor.
4. Charge density is highest, and electric field is strongest, on pointy parts of a conductor.
