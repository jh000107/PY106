# Pre-session 15: Lenz's Law

There is essentially a law of physics that centers just on the minus sigh in Faraday's law. This is known as:

**Lenz's Law**: if there is a complete circuit, the induced voltage sets up a current that creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in magnetic flux.

Note that Lenz’s law is consistent with energy conservation - if we move a magnet near a coil, for instance, the work we do to move the magnet against the resistive force of the coil is converted to electrical energy, which could be used to light a light bulb.

(a) -> current flowing clock-wise (b) -> current flowing counterclock-wise

Here are the four basic steps to follow for the pictorial method:

1. Draw a picture (the “Before” picture) showing the field lines passing through the loop before a change occurs. Sketch a circle to represent the loop, and then draw a few x symbols inside the circle if the field lines are going into the screen, or a few o symbols if the field lines are directed out of the screen.
2. Draw a similar picture (the “After” picture) showing the field lines passing through the loop after a change occurs.
3. Draw a “To Oppose” picture, showing the direction of the field lines the loop must create to oppose the change in flux that has taken place between the Before and After pictures. Only one field line (either one x or one o) is needed, because this is just a qualitative method to determine the direction of the induced current.
4. Using the right-hand rule, determine the direction of the induced current needed to produce the field in the “To Oppose” picture, and add that to the “To Oppose” picture. This is the right-hand rule that relates a current to the magnetic field produced by that current. The way I do that rule in this context is to stick the thumb on my right hand in the direction of the field on the “To Oppose” picture, and curl my fingers on my right hand to show the direction of the induced current that produces that field.
