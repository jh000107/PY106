# Connections

## Connections between force, field, potential energy and potential

### Force and field

$\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$ or $\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}$

Both force and field are **vectors**. When the charged object is positive, the force the charged object experiences is in the same direction as the field at the point where the oject is placed. If the object has a negative charge, the force the object experiences is opposite in direction to the field.

### Potential energy and potential

$U = qV$ or $V = \frac{U}{q}$

The total potential energy associated with the object interacting with all the other charged objects that contributed to the potential is the potential multiplied by the charge on the object being placed at the point.

Both potential energy and potential are **scalars**

In the uniform field situation, the change in potential energy when moving a charged object from one place to another

$\Delta{U} = q\Delta{V}$

The force it experiences at each location points in the direction of the fastest decrease in potential energy, and the magnitude of the force can be found by taking the magnitude of the change in potential energy between two nearby locations and dividing by the distance between the locations.

The field at each location points in the direction of the fastest decrease in potential, and the magnitude of the field can be found by taking the magnitude of the change in potential between two nearby locations and dividing by the distance between the locations.

An object of charge q in a uniform electric field E directed straight down. If the object is positive, moving the object down decreases the potential energy the fastest, so the force points down. If the object is negative the force would point up. For two points located a vertical distance d apart, the magnitude of the electric force is the magnitude of the change in electric potential energy (qEd) divided by the distance moved parallel to the field (d), so that's the qE force.
