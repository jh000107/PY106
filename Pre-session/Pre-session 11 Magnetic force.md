# Pre-session 11: Magnetic force


## Magnetic force

The force exerted by a magnetic field on a charged particle has some interesting properties. Just like the force exerted by an electric field, the force exerted by a magnetic field is proportional to the charge q, and the strength of the field, B. The differences are:

* A magnetic field exerts no force on a chrage that is at rest.
* A magnetic field exerts no force on a charge moving parallel to the field.
* The magnetic force is proportional to the speed of the charge.
* The magnetic force is perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the velocity of the charge.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is given by:

$F_m = qvB * sin\theta$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field. The force is maximized when this angle is 90 degrees.

## Possible paths

When a charged particle is moving in a uniform magnetic field, there are three possible paths that the particle can follow:

* if the velocity of the particle is parallel to the field, the magnetic field applies no force. In that case, the velocity is unchanged, and the particle exhibits straight-line motion.
* if the velocity of the particle is perpendicular to the field, the magnetic field applies a force to the particle that results in uniform circular motion.
* more generally, the particle has a velocity with a component parallel to the field and a component perpendicular to the field. This results in uniform circular motion on top of straight-line motion - the particle follows a spiral path.

When the velocity of the charged particle is perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the field is uniform, the particle experiences uniform circular motion. The force applied by the magnetic field in this case is

$F = qvB$

Think back to uniform circular motion, where we know that the force is equal to:

$F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

$qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

$r = \frac{mv}{qB}$
