# Pre-session 6: Capacitors

## Capacitors

A device for storing charge.

The capacitance (C) represents the amount of charge that can be stored in a capacitor per volt of potential difference across it. For a parallel-plate capacitor, in which each plate has an area A and the plates are a distance d apart, the capacitance is given by:

$C=\frac{\varepsilon_0A}{d}$

where $\varepsilon_0 = \frac{1}{4\pi k}$ = $8.85*10^{-12}$ is called the **permittivity of free space.**

However, we can increase the capacitance by filling the space between the plates with a piece of insulating material. We call the insulating material a dielectric and is characterized by a dielectric constant, $\kappa$, and the more general capacitance equation is:

$C=\frac{\kappa \varepsilon_0A}{d}$

In general, our goal in using a capacitor is to store charge. When the capacitor is connected to the battery, the battery pumps electrons from one plate to another. This gives a charge of +Q on one plate and -Q on the other.

$Q = C\Delta V$

1. The capacitor stays connected to a battery. In this case, the capacitor voltage is constant, because it is the battery voltage. Then, adjusting something about the capacitor (such as the distance between the plates, or whether there is a dielectric between the plates) will affect the amount of charge stored in the capacitor.

2. The capacitor is first charged by being connected to a battery, and then the connection to the battery is removed. After this, the charge on the capacitor is constant, because there is no way for the charge to get from one plate to the other. Adjusting something about the capacitor in this case affects the potential difference across the capacitor.

Another way to think about capacitors is that they store energy. The energy is stored in the electric field between the capacitor plates. This field points from the positive plate to the negative plate. If we say that d is the distance between the plates and the capacitor has a potential difference Î”V across it, the magnitude of the field is:

$E = \frac{\Delta V}{d}$ 

Three equivalent ways to express the amount of energy stored in the capacitor:

$U = \frac{1}{2}Q\Delta V = \frac{1}{2}C(\Delta V)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C}$
