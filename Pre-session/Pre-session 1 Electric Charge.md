# Pre-session 1: Electric Charge

## Observation

Place a nylon rod on a rotating stand. Bring another nylon rod close to the first rod, without allowing them to touch.

**Nothing happens**

Repeat after rubbing both rods with felt.

**Now the rods repel one another. How can we explain this?**

Rubbing a nylon rod with felt transfers electrons from one to the other, giving the rod a net charge. Both rods have a net charge of the same sign, ***and like charges repel***.

What happens when a rubber rod, after being rubbed with fur, is brought close to a nylon rod that has been rubbed with felt?

**The rods attract, although that is not obvious from our previous observations. The attraction tells us that the rods are oppositely charged, because *unline charges attract*.**

## The Triboelectric Series

An object can acquire a net charge by touching another material. Which material acquires electrons is determined by where the materials fit in the triboelectric series.

**MORE POSITIVE**

* rabbit's fur
* glass
* nylon
* cat's fur
* silk
* polyethylene
* rubber balloon

**MORE NEGATIVE**

When materials are rubbed together, the one higher up the list gives electrons to the one further down the list.

Nylon is higher up than felt, so nlyon gives up electrons, becoming positive, when rubbed with felt.

## Our basic model of electric charge

 Two kinds of electric charge, POSITVE and NEGATIVE

Objects are generally charged by either acquiring extra electrons, or giving up electrons.

Forces between charged objects can be very large. Such forces are really what stop us from falling through the floor, for instance. In other words, what we called the normal force is really associated with repulsive forces between electrons.

Our symbol for charge is Q or q. The unit is the coulomb (C).

## Charge is quantied

Charge is quantized - in general, charge comes in integer multiples of e, the magnitude of the charge on the electron.

e = 1.60 * 10^-19 C

An electron has a charge of -e; a proton has a charge of +e.

## Some elementary particles

Electron = -e / Proton = e / Neutron = 0

## Charge is conserved

Charge is conserved - the net charge in a closed system is constant.

## Classifying materials

We can classify materials into three broad categories, based on how easily charge flows through them.

Conductors: charge flows easily

Semi-conductors: charge flows, but not easily

Insulators: very little charge flows
