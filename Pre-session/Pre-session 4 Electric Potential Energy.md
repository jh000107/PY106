# Pre-session 4: Electric Potential Energy

## Point Charges

For two objects, with charges of q and Q, separted by a distance r, the potential energy is given by:

Potential energy can be positive, if the signs on the charges are the same (repel) or negative, if the charges have opposite signs (attract). The potential energy is zero when the distance between the charged objects is infinite.

More than two charged objects interacting? Simply add up the potential energies from each interacing pair.

No matter where the zero is, we should all agree on the change in potential energy.

Moving a charged particle around in a uniform electric field:

Moving the object up, when the electric force is down, increases the electric potential energy of the system.

One important difference between a gravitational field and an electric field is that mass can only be positive, but charge can be positive or negative.

When we released a ball of mass m from rest in a uniform gravitational field g, we found that the speed the ball would have after traveling a distance h was:

Let's do a similar thing for a ball of mass m with a charge q, but not it is released from rest in a uniform electric field E. Now, we neglect gravity, and assume the electric force dominates. After the ball travels a distance h in the field, after being released from rest, what is its speed?

Here, we apply energy conservation:

Potential energy = Force * height

Kinetic energy = 1/2 mv^2

solving for the speed gives:
