# Motional emf and eddy currents

When a conducting rod is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field applies a force to the charged particles in the rod, because they are moving with the rod. The conduction electrons in the rod can respond to this force, moving such that there is a charge separation, and thus a potential difference. We call this potential difference a **motional emf**.
