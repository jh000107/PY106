# Pre-session 10: Kirchnoff's rules

## Kirchhoff's rules

**The junction rule: The total current flowing into a junction equals the total current flowing out of the junction.**

The junction rule is consistent with conservation of charge. The total rate of flow of charge in has to be equal to the total rate of flow of charge out.

**The loop rule: for any complete loop in a circuit, the sum of the potential differences must be zero.**

The loop rule is consistent with energy conservation. If we imagine a single charge flowing around a loop, maybe getting energy boosts from a battery and giving up energy to resistors, when it returns to a particular location in the loop the charge has the same energy each time.
