# Pre-session 2: Coulomb's Law

## The force between electric charges

Two charged objects, of charge q1 and q2, separated by a distance r, exert a force on one another. The magnitude of this force is given by:

where k is a constant:

Note that Coulomb's law has the same form as the gravitational force between objects that interact because they both have mass.

One big difference between the force between charged objects and a gravitational interaction is that the gravitational force is always **attractive**.

### Example - Inside the hydrogen atom

Determine the ratio of the magnitude of the electrostatic force to the magnitude of the gravitational force between the proton and electron.

Note that we don't need to know the value of r, the distance between the electron and the proton, because it cancels out in the ratio.
