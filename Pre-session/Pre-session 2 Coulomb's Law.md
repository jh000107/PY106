# Pre-session 2: Coulomb's Law

## The force between electric charges

Two charged objects, of charge q1 and q2, separated by a distance r, exert a force on one another. The magnitude of this force is given by:

![F = k \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}](Pre-session 2 Coulomb's Law.assets/coulomb_s_law.svg)

where k is a constant:

k = 8.99*10^9 N m^2/C^2
