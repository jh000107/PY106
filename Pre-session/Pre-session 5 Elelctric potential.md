# Pre-session 5: Elelctric potential

## Electric Potential

Electric potential is another way that we visualize how a charged particle, or a set of charged particles, influences the space around it. Unlike field, electric potential is a scalar, which can be positive or negative.

The field points in the direction of the fastest decrease of potential. For another, the magnitude of the field is the change in potential between two closely spaced points, divided by the distance between them.

We will look at the potential for one or more charges. Then, we look at the potential when the field is uniform.

## Point charges

The potential a distance r away from a single point charge of charge q is:
$$
V = \frac{kq}{r}
$$
When there are multiple point charges, the net electric potential at a point is found by adding the contributions from each point charge. The sign on the potential comes from the sign on the charge itself. In other words, positive charges only make positive contributions to the net electric potential, and negative charges only make negative contributions to the net electric potential.

## Uniform Field

In a uniform field, the magnitude of the electric field can be found from the equation:

where change in V represents the change in potential between two points separated by a distance d. This is true when to get from one point to the other, you go in the direction of the fastest decrease in potential.

Thus, in case 1, we can go from the point on the 70V equipotential directly above the green point, 10 cm down to the green point, which is on the 60 V equipotential. This gives us a field of -(-10V) / 0.1m = 100 V/m, and we know the field is directed down.

Lets now connect potential and potential energy. 

**What is the change in potential energy?** Well, the potential energy is given by:

$U = qV$

So, the initial potential energy is +60 nJ and the final potential energy is +70 nJ. The potential energy has increased by 10 nJ.

**How much work do we do in this process?** One way: apply the five-term energy conservation equation.

$U_i + K_i + W_{nc} = U_f + K_f$

There is no initial or final kinetic energy (the particle starts and ends at rest).

$W_{nc} = U_f - U_i = 70 nJ -60nJ = +10nJ$

**How much work is done by the field in this process?**

One way to do it is to remember that the work done by the field is the negative of the change in potential energy, so that gets us -10 nJ.
