# Pre-sesison 23: Standing waves

## Standing waves on a string fixed at both ends

A standing wave on a string comes about from the interference between two identical traveling waves, one traveling to the right and the other to the left.

The string is fixed at both ends. A wave that encounters a fixed end will reflect so that it comes back inverted.

These waves only build up into a standing waves when an integer number of half wavelengths fit into the length of the string. The lowest six frequencies when this happens are shown in the simulation - these are known as the harmonics of the string.  The lowest frequency, corresponding to half a wavelength fitting in the length of the string, is called the **fundamental**. The second harmonic is twice the frequency of the fundamental, the third harmonic is three times the frequency, etc. In general, the n'th harmonic is n times the fundamental.

$n\frac{\lambda}{2} = L$

$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$

$f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = \frac{nv}{2L}$

## A pipe open at both ends

Similar to how a transverse standing wave is formed on a string, a standing wave in the air column in a pipe comes about from the interference between two identical traveling waves, one traveling to the right and the other to the left. With this being a sound wave, the standing wave is a longitudinal sound wave.  

When a traveling wave in the tube reaches the open end of the tube, it reflects like it has encountered a free end, which means that the wave will reflect so that it comes back upright. The same thing happens at the other end.

As with the string, these waves only build up into a standing waves when an integer number of half wavelengths fit into the length of the pipe. The lowest five frequencies when this happens are shown in the simulation - these are known as the harmonics of the pipe.  The lowest frequency, corresponding to half a wavelength fitting in the length of the pipe, is called the **fundamental**. The second harmonic is twice the frequency of the fundamental, the third harmonic is three times the frequency, etc. In general, the n'th harmonic is n times the fundamental.

$n\frac{\lambda}{2} = L$

$\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}$

$f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = \frac{nv}{2L}$

## A pipe closed at one end

For a pipe with only one end open, we get a different result than we get with both ends open. The open end acts as a free end, but the closed end acts as a fixed end. The condition for resonance, in that case, is that the standing wave has an anti-node (for displacement of the molecules) at the open end, but it has a node at the closed end.  

The resonance condition is satisfied only when an odd integer number of quarter wavelengths fit into the length of the pipe. The lowest five frequencies when this happens are shown in the simulation.  In this case, the lowest frequency (the fundamental), has a quarter wavelength fitting in the length of the pipe. There are no even harmonics (even multiples of the fundamental), and the third harmonic is three times the frequency of the fundamental, the fifth harmonic is five times the frequency, etc. In general, the n'th harmonic is n times the fundamental.

$n\frac{\lambda}{4} = L$

$\lambda_n = \frac{4L}{n}$

$f_n = \frac{v}{\lambda_n} = \frac{nv}{4L}$
