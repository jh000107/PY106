# Pre-session 22: The Interference of Waves

**The principle of superposition**: When two (or more) waves come together, the net displacement is simply the sum of the displacements due to the individual waves.  

After passing by one another, the waves continue on as if they have never met.

**Constructive interference**: When the displacements of the individual waves are in the same direction, then the net displacement is larger than that due to any one individual wave. This larger displacement, arising from superposition, is known as constructive interference.

**Destructive interference**: When the displacements of the individual waves are in opposite directions, the result is either partial or full cancellation. This smaller, or zero, displacement is known as destructive interference.
