# Pre-sesison 21 - The Doppler effect

## A moving observer

The Doppler effect is the shift in frequency that can be observed when at least on of a source and an observer move. The general equation that related frequency, wave speed, and wavelength for waves is:

$f = \frac{v}{\lambda}$

The motion of the observer does not affect the wave speed, but it does affect the speed of the waves relative to the observer. Thus, the observer hears a frequency f' that is different from the frequency f sent out by the source. This observed frequency is simply:

$f` = \frac{v\pm v_0}{\lambda} = f (\frac{v\pm v_0}{v})$

Here, v is the speed of the waves in the medium, and $v_0$ is the speed of the observer. We use the + sign when the observer moves toward the source, and the - sign when the observer moves away from the source.

## A moving source

The motion of the source affects the wavelength. Again, the observer hears a frequency f` that is different from the frequency f sent out by the source. This observed frequency is:

$f` = \frac{v}{\lambda`} = f(\frac{v}{v\pm v_s})$

## Doppler effect in general

 General equation that works for all cases, such as when both the source and the observer are moving.

The observed frequency is :

$f` = f(\frac{v\pm v_0}{v\pm v_s})$
