# Pre-session 20: Waves

## Waves

A wave is a disturbance that carries energy form one place to another. Our focus in this module is on **mechanical waves**, which require a medium, such as a string or air.

The wave shown above is a **transverse wave**, in which the particles in the medium experience displacements transverse to (perpendicular to) the direction the wave is traveling. A good example of such as wave is a wave on a string - many musical instruments utilize such waves, for instance.

If the particles in the medium experience displacements parallel to the direction the wave is moving, we call that a **longitudinal wave**. Sound waves are longitudinal waves, for example.

In the sinusoidal wave shown above, we describe the wave using a number of parameters, including:

The **frequency (f)**, measured in hertz (Hz), which is how many oscillations each particle of the medium undergoes every second. 

Closely related is the **period (T)**, the time for one complete oscillation.

$T = \frac{1}{f}$

The **wave speed (v)**, which is how fast the wave travels through the medium, is determined by properties of the medium. For a wave on a string, the wave speed is the square root of the tension divided by the string's mass per unit length.

$v = \sqrt {\frac{F_T}{m/L}}$

The **wavelength** ( λ ), which is the distance from one peak to the next, is determined by the frequency and wave speed.

$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = vT$

The wavelength is also the distance traveled by the wave in one period (T).

## The wave equation

$y(x,t) = A sin(ω t-kx)$

where $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is known as the wavenumber.
