# Pre-session 14: Magnetic flux and Faraday's Law

Magnetic flux is a measure of the number of magnetic field lines passing through an area. Note that we count field lines going a particular direction through the area as positive, and field lines going in the opposite direction as negative.

Magnetic flux: $\phi = BAcos(\theta)$

Wait, what's an area vector? Since when did area have a direction? Consider the screen of the device you are looking at this on. The magnitude of the area vector for the screen is the usual equation for area, length times width. However, we also assign a direction to the area, that direction being perpendicular to the screen itself.

To maximize the magnetic flux, you hold the loop so that there are the maximum number of field lines passing through it, as is shown in the figure above. This would put the area vector (which is perpendicular to the plane of the loop) parallel to the field lines.

If you rotate the loop 90 degrees, about an axis parallel to one of the sides of the loop, there will be no field lines at all passing through the loop, as above. In that case, the magnetic flux is zero.

At an intermediate position, as above, the magnetic flux is not zero but not as large as in the first figure above, because there are fewer field lines passing through the loop here than when the plane of the loop was perpendicular to the field.
