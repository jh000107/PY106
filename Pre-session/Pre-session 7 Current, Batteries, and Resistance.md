# Pre-session 7: Current, Batteries, and Resistance

## Battery basics

It does not create electrons. Instead, a chemical reaction that liberates electrons takes place at the negative terminal of the battery. If the battery is connected in a circuit, those electrons travel through the circuit, giving up energy along the way (such as to a light bulb or a toaster element), to the positive terminal of the battery. At the positive terminal, a different chemical reaction takes place that recycles the electrons, binding them into waste products. It is also critical that charge flows within the battery between the positive and negative terminals – this charge is often positive ions.

## Electrical resistance

Consider a cylindrical object, like a wire. The wire has a particular length, ***L***, and a cross-sectional area, ***A***. It is also made from a particular type of material, of course. If we connect the wire to a battery, then charge will flow - in other words, there will be a current in the wire. The flowing charges (usually electrons) generally have some difficulty passing through the wire. We characterize the wire by its **electrical resistance**, which is essentially a measure of how difficult it is for charges to flow through the wire.  On a microscopic level, we can say that the atoms in the wire get in the way of the conduction electrons (the electrons that are free to move around in response to an electric field), and that is one factor in electrical resistance. Another factor is how many such free electrons there are - for instance, metals have a high concentration of conduction electrons, leading to low resistance, while insulating materials have almost none, leading to high resistance.Our equation for electrical resistance, ***R***, is:

$ R=\frac{\rho L}A $

The Greek letter rho (*ρ*) is the **resistivity**, which is a constant that depends on the material.  Note that the unit of resistance is the ohm, which is symbolized by the Greek letter capital omega (Ω).

## Current and Ohm's law

We can then extract energy from that flowing charge to light up light bulbs, etc. The rate of flow of charge is known as **current**, usually symbolized by ***I***.

$I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$

Batteries and power supplies provide a potential difference, or voltage, in a circuit. Having a potential difference Δ***V*** across a resistor creates an electric field in the resistor, and the electrons respond by moving. The rate at which the charges flow is given by Ohm's law:

$ I=\frac{\triangle V}R$ or $\Delta V = IR$

## Electrical Power

Power is the time rate of change of energy. If we divide the change in electrical potentia lenergy by time, we get:

$P = \frac{q\Delta V}{t} = \frac{q}{t}\Delta V = I\Delta V$

Using Ohm's law, $\Delta V = IR$

Electrical Power: $P = I\Delta V = I^2R = \frac{(\Delta V)^2}{R}$



## Measuring current and voltage

To measure current, we use an anmeter. Ammeters exploit the fact that, when two circuit components are placed in series with one another, they have the same current through them. Thus, to measure the current passing through some component of a circuit, like a resistor, the ammeter is placed in series with that component.

When you add an ammeter to a circuit, it will change the circuit and actually change the current that you're trying to measure. To minimize the impact of adding the ammeter, the ammeter should have a much lower resistance than the resistance of whatever you are trying to measure the current through.

To measure the potential difference across a circuit component, we use a voltmeter. Voltmeters exploit the fact that, when two circuit components are placed in parallel with one another, they have the same potential difference across them. Thus, to measure the potential difference across some component of a circuit, like a resistor, the voltmeter is placed in parallel with that component.

When you add a voltmeter to a circuit, it will change the circuit and actually change the potential difference that you're trying to measure. To minimize the impact of adding the voltmeter, the voltmeter should have a much higher resistance than the resistance of whatever you are trying to measure the potential difference across. The higher the resistance of the voltmeter, the lower the amount of current that is diverted through the voltmeter.

## Electricity cost

The kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy.

The cost of running an electrical device is given by:

Cost = (Power rating in kW) x (hours the device is on) * (cost per kW-hr)
