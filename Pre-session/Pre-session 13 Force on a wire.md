# Pre-session 13: Force on a wire

## Force on a wire

A current is just a set of moving charges. Hence, we can apply the idea that a magnetic field can also exert a force on a current-carrying wire.

$F = qvBsin\theta$

We can say that the speed v is some length (L) divided by some time interval $\Delta t$. Thus,

$F = \frac{qLB}{\Delta t}sin\theta$

But charge divided by time is current, so our equation become

$F = ILB sin\theta$

## Producing a magnetic field

Magnetic field apply forces to moving charges. It turns out that magnetic fields are produced by moving charges, too.

A current in a wire is a common and simple example of a set of moving charges. The current from a long, straight current-carrying wire, at a distance **r** from the wire, is:

$B = \frac{u_0I}{2\pi r}$
