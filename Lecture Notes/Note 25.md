## Wave Reflections

What happens when a wave hits a wall? -> Depends of the wall

Hard wall: points on wall don't move (fixed end)

Soft wall: points can move (end of string is a free end)

## General rules for strings and pipes

* Fixed end is always a node (no movement)
  * fixed end of a string or metal rod
  * closed end of pipe
* Free end is always an anti-node (max-movement)
  * End of string or rod that can vibrate
  * Open end of a pipe

## Standing Waves: string fixed at both ends

* All stringed musical instruments have strings fixed at both ends
* When tey are played, you hear a combination of the fundamental, or resonant, frequency and the different harmonics

## Standing waves on strings (both ends fixed)

When v increases, frequency also increases.
