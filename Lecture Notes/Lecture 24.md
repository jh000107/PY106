## Sound Intensity

Sound waves carry energy through a medium over time, usually defined as:

"Intensity" $I = \frac{P}{A} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$

## Approaching the Sound Barrier

* If the source travels at the speed of sound, the wave fronts pile up and move along with the source
* All the peaks are at the same place, so the wavelength is zero and the frequency is infinite
* The overlay of all the waves prodcues a shock wave known as a sonic boom

## Wave Interference

### Adding Waves: Superposition

When more than one wave is traveling in a medium, the waves simply add together!

**The principle of superposition...**

Net displacement of any point in the medium is the sum of the displacements due to each individual wave

### Constructive Interference

* When displacements of individual waves go in the same direction at a particular point on the wave, the result is an increasing magnitude of amplitude. After passing through one another, waves (or pulses) travel as if they had never met

### Destructive Interference

* When the displacements of individual waves are in opposite directions at a point, the waves cancel (at least partially)

### Beats

* When you listen to two sound waves of similar frequency, you hear **beats** - the intensity of the sound rising and falling
* When the waves are exactly **in phase** with one another, **constructive interference** produces a loud sound
* Waves of different frequencies drift **out of phase** until complete **destructive interference** occurs and you hear nothing.

$f_{beat} = |f_1 -f_2|$
