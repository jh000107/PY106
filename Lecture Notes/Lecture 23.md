## Sound

* Speed of sound waves determined by the medium - you can't change this!
* Nature decides this: $v = f\lambda$

## Stationary or moving you, relative to source

* When stationary, you observe sound wave peaks at the same frequency they are emitted
* When you move toward yhe source, you observe sound wave peaks more frequently.
  * When you stop, you observe sound wave peaks at the same frequency they are emitted

## Typical Doppler Effect Problem:

If a source emits sound waves at a particular frequency f, how do you calculate the observed frequency f' of the waves if the source, and/or observer, are moving?

$f' = f(\frac{v\pm v_0}{v\pm v_s})$
