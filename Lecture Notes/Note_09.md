## Energy stored in a capacitor

The electric force is a conservative force, just like gravity. This means that the work the battery is doing to move electrons from the positive plate to the negative plate is always the same, regardless of the the electron’s particular path between the plates

Each electron is moving along a path that isn’t going directly between the plates! However, the work (total energy) required to move each electron from the top plate to the bottom plate is $U = q\Delta V$. The work is the same if the electrons were to move on a direct path downward, from the top plate to the bottom plate.

The average potential of the capacitor is simply $1/2\Delta V$

So, the total energy stored inside the capacitor after moving Q total charge from one plate to the other is:

$U = \frac{1}{2}Q\Delta V$

## Does $\Delta V$ change?

After charging, the voltage source is disconnected from the capacitor. Does $\Delta V$ change when Styrofoam insulator is inserted between the plates?

YES. when we increase $\kappa$, the capacitance C increases, Q doesn't change, so $\Delta V$ decreases.
