What's the sign of the charge?

Negative... because the qE force is in a direction **opposite** to the field

What's the magnitude of the charge?
$$
qE = mg \\
q = \frac{mg}{E}
$$
The ball is at equilibrium so the horizontal forces have to balance each other, and the vertical forces have to balance each other.
$$
F\sin \theta = qE \\
F\cos \theta = mg \\
\tan \theta = \frac{qE}{mg} \\
q = \frac{mg\tan\theta}{E}
$$

## Potential Energy Difference (Uniform fields)

The change in potential energy is **positive** if the object is moved **opposite** to the force applied by the field, and **negative** if it is moved in the **same** direction as the force applied by the field.
