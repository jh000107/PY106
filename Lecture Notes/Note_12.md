# Note_12

## Resistors in series

Two resistors A and B that are in series can be replaced by an equivalent resistor with resistance

$R_{AB} = R_A + R_B$

In series:

* same amount of current flows through both resistors
* difference voltage drop over each resistor unless the resistors have same R

## Resistors in parallel

Two resistors A and B that are in parallel can be replaced by an equivalent resistor with resistance

$\frac{1}{R_{AB}}=\frac{1}{R_A}+\frac{1}{R_B}$

## How bright does each bulb shine?

The bulbs shine brighter if they dissipate more power in the form of heat
